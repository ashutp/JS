//what is dom?
//Dom is a tree like representation of your html document that javascript can understand and manipulate.

//Key Concept.
//Everything is a Node.
//Element Nodes:<div>,<p>,<h1>.
//Text Nodes: the actual text content.
//Document Node: the Root node.

//Html element convert in js object.
//Before:
//<h1 id="title">Hello</h1>

//After :tag conversion
// {
//     tagName:"h1",
//     id:"title",
//     textcontent:"Hello",
// }
//"Every HTML tag becomes a JavaScript object with properties and methods!"

//Window and Document?
//In JavaScript, the window object represents the browser window, while the document object represents the web page content loaded within that window. The document object is a property of the window object and is the entry point for manipulating the page's structure, content, and style using the Document Object Model (DOM)
